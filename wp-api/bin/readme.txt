Access your site's data through an easy-to-use HTTP REST API. (Version 2)

== Description ==
WordPress is moving towards becoming a fully-fledged application framework, and we need new APIs. This project was born to create an easy-to-use, easy-to-understand and well-tested framework for creating these APIs, plus creating APIs for core.

This plugin provides an easy to use REST API, available via HTTP. Grab your site's data in simple JSON format, including users, posts, taxonomies and more. Retrieving or updating data is as simple as sending a HTTP request.

Want to get your site's posts? Simply send a `GET` request to `/wp-json/wp/v2/posts`. Update user with ID 4? Send a `PUT` request to `/wp-json/wp/v2/users/4`. Get all posts with the search term "awesome"? `GET /wp-json/wp/v2/posts?filter[s]=awesome`. It's that easy.

WP API exposes a simple yet easy interface to WP Query, the posts API, post meta API, users API, revisions API and many more. Chances are, if you can do it with WordPress, WP API will let you do it.

WP API also includes an easy-to-use Javascript API based on Backbone models, allowing plugin and theme developers to get up and running without needing to know anything about the details of getting connected.

Check out [our documentation][docs] for information on what's available in the API and how to use it. We've also got documentation on extending the API with extra data for plugin and theme developers!

All tickets for the project are being tracked on [GitHub][]. You can also take a look at the [recent updates][] for the project.

[docs]: http://v2.wp-api.org/
[GitHub]: https://github.com/WP-API/WP-API
[recent updates]: http://make.wp-api.org/

== Installation ==

Drop this directory in and activate it.

For full-flavoured API support, you'll need to be using pretty permalinks to use the plugin, as it uses custom rewrite rules to power the API.

== Changelog ==

= 2.0 Beta 7.0 =

* Sync infrastructure from WordPress core as of r35691.

  * Remove `register_api_field()` because it's conceptually tied to `WP_REST_Controller` [#34730](https://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/34730)
  * Update the REST API header links to use api.w.org [#34303](https://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/34303)

  (props @danielbachhuber, [#1726](https://github.com/WP-API/WP-API/pull/1726))

= 2.0 Beta 6.0 =

* Remove global inclusion of wp-admin/includes/admin.php

  For a long time, the REST API loaded wp-admin/includes/admin.php to make use of specific admin utilities. Now, it only loads those admin utilities when it needs them.

  If your custom endpoints make use of admin utilities, you'll need to make sure to load wp-admin/includes/admin.php before you use them.

  (props @joehoyle, [#1696](https://github.com/WP-API/WP-API/pull/1696))

* Link directly to the featured image in a Post's links.

* Clarify documentation for `date` and `modified` attributes.

  (props @danielbachhuber, [#1715](https://github.com/WP-API/WP-API/pull/1715))

* Update the wp-api.js client from the client-js repo.

  (props @rachelbaker, [#1709](https://github.com/WP-API/WP-API/pull/1709))

  (props @joehoyle, [#1707](https://github.com/WP-API/WP-API/pull/1707))

* Run revisions for collection through `prepare_response_for_collection()`.

  (props @danielbachhuber, @rachelbaker, [#1671](https://github.com/WP-API/WP-API/pull/1671))

* Expose `date_gmt` for `view` context of Posts and Comments.

  (props @danielbachhuber, [#1690](https://github.com/WP-API/WP-API/pull/1690))

* Fix PHP and JS docblock formatting.

  (props @ahmadawais, [#1699](https://github.com/WP-API/WP-API/pull/1698), [#1699](https://github.com/WP-API/WP-API/pull/1699), [#1701](https://github.com/WP-API/WP-API/pull/1701), [#1700](https://github.com/WP-API/WP-API/pull/1700), [#1702](https://github.com/WP-API/WP-API/pull/1702), [#1703](https://github.com/WP-API/WP-API/pull/1703))

* Include `media_details` attribute for attachments in embed context.

  For image attachments, media_details includes a sizes array of image sizes, which is useful for templating.

  (props @danielbachhuber, [#1667](https://github.com/WP-API/WP-API/pull/1667))

* Make `WP_REST_Controller` error messages more helpful by specifying method to subclass.

  (props @danielbachhuber, [#1670](https://github.com/WP-API/WP-API/pull/1670))

* Expose `slug` in `embed` context for Users.

  `user_nicename` is a public attribute, used in user URLs, so this is safe data to present.

  (props @danielbachhuber, [#1666](https://github.com/WP-API/WP-API/pull/1666))

* Handle falsy value from `wp_count_terms()`, fixing fatal.

  (props @joehoyle, [#1641](https://github.com/WP-API/WP-API/pull/1641))

* Correct methods in `WP_REST_SERVER::EDITABLE` description.

  (props @rachelbaker, [#1601](https://github.com/WP-API/WP-API/pull/1601))

* Return the trashed status of deleted posts/comments.

  When a post or a comment is deleted, returns a flag to say whether it's been trashed or properly deleted.

  (props @pento, [#1499](https://github.com/WP-API/WP-API/pull/1499))

* In `WP_REST_Posts_Controller::update_item()`, check the post ID based on the proper post type.

  (props @rachelbaker, [#1497](https://github.com/WP-API/WP-API/pull/1497))

= 2.0 Beta 5.0 =

* Load api-core as a compatibility library

  Now api-core has been merged into WordPress trunk (for 4.4) we should no longer load the infrastructure code when it's already available. This also fixes a fatal error for users who were on trunk.

  (props @rmccue)

* Switch to new mysql_to_rfc3339

  (props @rmccue)

* Double-check term taxonomy

  (props @rmccue)

* Load admin functions

  This was removed from the latest beta of WordPress in the REST API infrastructure, a more long term fix is planned.

  (props @joehoyle)

* Add Add compat shim for renamed `rest_mysql_to_rfc3339()`

  (props @danielbachhuber)

* Compat shim for `wp_is_numeric_array()`

  (props @danielbachhuber)

* Revert Switch to register_post_type_args filter

  (props @joehoyle)

= 2.0 Beta 4.0 =

* Show public user information through the user controller.

  In WordPress as of [r32683](https://core.trac.wordpress.org/changeset/32683) (scheduled for 4.3), `WP_User_Query` now has support for getting users with published posts.

  To match current behaviour in WordPress themes and feeds, we now expose this public user information. This includes the avatar, description, user ID, custom URL, display name, and URL, for users who have published at least one post on the site. This information is available to all clients; other fields and data for all users are still only available when authenticated.

  (props @joehoyle, @rmccue, @Shelob9, [#1397][gh-1397], [#839][gh-839], [#1435][gh-1435])

* Send schema in OPTIONS requests and index.

  Rather than using separate `/schema` endpoints, the schema for items is now available through an OPTIONS request to the route. This means that full documentation is now available for endpoints through an OPTIONS request; this includes available methods, what data you can pass to the endpoint, and the data you'll get back.

  This data is now also available in the main index and namespace indexes. Simply request the index with `context=help` to get full schema data. Warning: this response will be huge. The schema for single endpoints is also available in the collection's OPTIONS response.

  **⚠️ This breaks backwards compatibility** for clients relying on schemas being at their own routes. These clients should instead send `OPTIONS` requests.

  Custom endpoints can register their own schema via the `schema` option on the route. This option should live side-by-side with the endpoints (similar to `relation` in WP's meta queries), so your registration call will look something like:

  ```php
  register_rest_route( 'test-ns', '/test', array(
    array(
      'methods' => 'GET',
      'callback' => 'my_test_callback',
    ),

    'schema' => 'my_schema_callback',
  ) );
  ```

  (props @rmccue, [#1415][gh-1415], [#1222][gh-1222], [#1305][gh-1305])

* Update JavaScript API for version 2.

  Our fantastic JavaScript API from version 1 is now available for version 2, refreshed with the latest and greatest changes.

  As a refresher: if you want to use it, simply make your script depend on `wp-api` when you enqueue it. If you want to enqueue the script manually, add `wp_enqueue_script( 'wp-api' )` to a callback on `wp_enqueue_scripts`.

  (props @tlovett1, @kadamwhite, @nathanrice, [#1374][gh-1374], [#1320][gh-1320])

* Embed links inside items in a collection.

  Previously when fetching a collection of items, you only received the items themselves. To fetch the links as well via embedding, you needed to make a request to the single item with `_embed` set.

  No longer! You can now request a collection with embeds enabled (try `/wp/v2/posts?_embed`). This will embed links inside each item, allowing you to build interface items much easier (for example, post archive pages can get featured image data at the same time).

  This also applies to custom endpoints. Any endpoint that returns a list of objects will automatically have the embedding applied to objects inside the list.

  (props @rmccue, [#1459][gh-1459], [#865][gh-865])

* Fix potential XSS vulnerability.

  Requests from other origins could potentially run code on the API domain, allowing cross-origin access to authentication cookies or similar.

  Reported by @xknown on 2015-07-23.

* Move `/posts` `WP_Query` vars back to `filter` param.

  In version 1, we had internal `WP_Query` vars available via `filter` (e.g. `filter[s]=search+term`). For our first betas of version 2, we tried something different and exposed these directly on the endpoint. The experiment has now concluded; we didn't like this that much, so `filter` is back.

  We plan on adding nicer looking arguments to collections in future releases, with a view towards being consistent across different collections. We also plan on opening up the underlying query vars via `filter` for users, comments, and terms as well.

  **⚠️ This breaks backwards compatibility** for users using WP Query vars. Simply change your `x=y` parameter to `filter[x]=y`.

  (props @WP-API, [#1420][gh-1420])

* Respect `rest_base` for taxonomies.

  **⚠️ This breaks backwards compatibility** by changing the `/wp/v2/posts/{id}/terms/post_tag` endpoint to `/wp/v2/posts/{id}/tag`.

  (props @joehoyle, [#1466][gh-1466])

* Add permission check for retrieving the posts collection in edit context.

  By extension of the fact that getting any individual post yields a forbidden context error when the `context=edit` and the user is not authorized, the user should also not be permitted to list any post items when unauthorized.

  (props @danielpunkass, [#1412][gh-1412])

* Ensure the REST API URL always has a trailing slash.

  Previously, when pretty permalinks were enabled, the API URL during autodiscovery looked like `/wp-json`, whereas the non-pretty permalink URL looked like `?rest_route=/`. These are now consistent, and always end with a slash character to simplify client URL building.

  (props @danielpunkass, @rmccue, [#1426][gh-1426], [#1442][gh-1442], [#1455][gh-1455], [#1467][gh-1467])

* Use `wp_json_encode` instead of `json_encode`

  Since WordPress 4.1, `wp_json_encode` has been available to ensure encoded values are sane, and that non-UTF8 encodings are supported. We now use this function rather than doing the encode ourselves.

  (props @rmccue, @pento, [#1417][gh-1417])

* Add `role` to schema for users.

  The available roles you can assign to a user are now available in the schema as an `enum`.

  (props @joehoyle, [#1400][gh-1400])

* Use the schema for validation inside the comments controller.

  Previously, the schema was merely a decorative element for documentation inside the comments controller. To bring it inline with our other controllers, the schema is now used internally for validation.

  (props @joehoyle, [#1422][gh-1422])

* Don't set the Location header in update responses.

  Previously, the Location header was sent when updating resources due to some inadvertent copypasta. This header should only be sent when creating to direct clients to the new resource, and isn't required when you're already on the correct resource.

  (props @rachelbaker, [#1441][gh-1441])

* Re-enable the `rest_insert_post` action hook for `WP_REST_Posts_Controller`

  This was disabled during 2.0 development to avoid breaking lots of plugins on the `json_insert_post` action. Now that we've changed namespaces and are Mostly Stable (tm), we can re-enable the action.

  (props @jaredcobb, [#1427][gh-1427], [#1424][gh-1424])

* Fix post taxonomy terms link URLs.

  When moving the routes in a previous beta, we forgot to correct the links on post objects to the new correct route. Sorry!

  (props @rachelbaker, @joehoyle, [#1447][gh-1447], [#1383][gh-1383])

* Use `wp_get_attachment_image_src()` on the image sizes in attachments.

  Since the first versions of the API, we've been building attachment URLs via `str_replace`. Who knows why we were doing this, but it caused problems with custom attachment URLs (such as CDN-hosted images). This now correctly uses the internal functions and filters.

  (props @joehoyle, [#1462][gh-1462])

* Make the embed context a default, not forced.

  If you want embeds to bring in full data rather than with `context=edit`, you can now change the link to specify `context=view` explicitly.

  (props @rmccue, [#1464][gh-1464])

* Ensure we always use the `term_taxonomy_id` and never expose `term_id` publicly.

  Previously, `term_id` was inadvertently exposed in some error responses.

  (props @jdolan, [#1430][gh-1430])

* Fix adding alt text to attachments on creation.

  Previously, this could only be set when updating an attachment, not when creating one.

  (props @joehoyle, [#1398][gh-1398])

* Throw an error when registering routes without a namespace.

  Namespaces should **always** be provided when registering routes. We now throw a `doing_it_wrong` error when attempting to register one. (Previously, this caused a warning, or an invalid internal route.)

  If you *really* need to register namespaceless routes (e.g. to replicate an existing API), call `WP_REST_Server::register_route` directly rather than using the convenience function.

  (props @joehoyle, @rmccue, [#1355][gh-1355])

* Show links on embeds.

  Previously, links were accidentally stripped from embedded response data.

  (props @rmccue, [#1472][gh-1472])

* Clarify insufficient permisssion error when editing posts.

  (props @danielpunkass, [#1411][gh-1411])

* Improve @return inline docs for rest_ensure_response()

  (props @Shelob9, [#1328][gh-1328])

* Check taxonomies exist before trying to set properties.

  (props @joehoyle, @rachelbaker, [#1354][gh-1354])

* Update controllers to ensure we use `sanitize_callback` wherever possible.

  (props @joehoyle, [#1399][gh-1399])

* Add more phpDoc documentation, and correct existing documentation.

  (props @Shelob9, @rmccue, [#1432][gh-1432], [#1433][gh-1433], [#1465][gh-1465])

* Update testing infrastructure.

  Travis now runs our coding standards tests in parallel, and now uses the new, faster container-based testing infrastructure.

  (props @ntwb, @frozzare, [#1449][gh-1449], [#1457][gh-1457])

* Load the WP REST API before the main query runs.

  The `rest_api_loaded` function now hooks into the `parse_request` action.
  This change prevents the main query from being run on every request and
  allows sites to set `WP_USE_THEMES` to `false`.  Previously, the main query
  was always being run (`SELECT * FROM wp_posts LIMIT 10`), even though the
  result was never used and couldn't be cached.
